 Hi, I'm Nada Salem Mohamed, a second-year Artificial Intelligence student at Pharos University.
I'm passionate about robotics, intelligent systems, and embedded AI.

Iâ€™ve built an RFID-based attendance system using Arduino and created a sensor-based robot car during a robotics course at STSmart. These experiences helped me apply my technical skills and learn real-world problem solving.

Skills:
Python, Logic Circuits, Data Structures, Arduino, Linear Algebra, Probability, and Statistics.

I'm looking forward to contributing to open-source AI and robotics projects and growing through collaboration and hands-on learning.
